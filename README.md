# üåÆ taco

Taco is a bunch of components that work as layout primitives written with ReasonReact and styled-ppx available in JavaScript, TypeScript and Reason/OCaml.

- Single-focused components
- Highly composable
- Type-safe
- Strong defaults
- Predictable APIs
- A rich set of components that can represent all your app
- Usable on Reason, JavaScript and TypeScript.

‚ö†Ô∏è Not ready for consumption, is totally possible since I'm using them but isn't publish to npm or the bindings to JS/TS aren't polished.
